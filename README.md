# Alien Survivors
A godot prototype to learn the engine.

## Goal of the game
Survive as long as you can, killing enemies and powering yourself up and selecting the upgrades you choose.
The weapon shoots automatically to the nearest enemy, you only control the ship and select upgrades when you level up. 
The more time you survive, the more enemies will spawn. Every once in a while, squadrons of aliens will swarm at you.
When an enemy dies, they might drop an experience crystal, grab it to gain experience. Grab enough and you'll gain a level.
Droge the enemies, kill them, gain enough experience to level up and select the best power ups to survive as long as you can!

# Power Ups
Each time you level up, you can select one of three random power ups:

**Player Speed boost**

**Player Max Health boost**

**Weapon Projectile** (your weapon can shoot more projectiles before recharging) 

**Weapon Duration and Rate of fire** (your laser lasts longer before disappearing and your weapon shoots more often)

**Weapon Crit Chance** (your laser has more chance to deal critical damage)

**Weapon Damage** (your laser deals more damage)

If you are REALLY lucky, you can also find a **Weapon Super Power Up** which will improve everything about your weapon! Don't miss it!

*Hint: Weapon Projectile power up is really strong!*
